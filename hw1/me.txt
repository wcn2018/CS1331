I am a first year CS major from St. Louis, Missouri.
My threads are intelligence and devices or sysarch. I have
a particular interest for data science, number theory, ML/NLP
and more theoretical CS stuff.
My hobbies include model aircraft, drawing, guitar and 
saxophone, hiking/camping and various outdoorsmanship.
I really wish St. Louis had a NBA team, but for now I'll
settle for the Heat.
