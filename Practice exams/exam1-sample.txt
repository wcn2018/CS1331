   1. Define the following terms:
      a. Instantiation
      b. Bytecode
      c. Encapsulation
      d. Compiler
      e. Relational operator
      f. Method signature


   2. Write the value and the data type of the expression in the space
      provided below 
      a.  7 - (6 * (5 * (3 / 1.5))) + 2
      b.  6 - 3 * 4 + 5 / 2
      c.  (((8 + 3) + (10 % 3)) * (5 - 3))
      d.  19 % 10 / 6
      e.  (int) (5.0/3)
      f.  9 / (float)3 + 2 - (7 / 2)


   3. Write a class named StringFun that reads a string (possibly multiple
      words) from the user and then prints out the first and last
      character from that string back to the user. 


   4. The following code segment has a compilation error.  Explain what
      the error will be and why it will occur.
   
      float val;
      double d1, d2;
      d2 = 10.0;
      d1 = d2 / 2;
      val = 4 + (2.0 * d1);
      System.out.println("the value is " + val);
   

   5. Assume you are using the Random class, write a line of code that
      returns
      a. One of the following random integers: 10, 100, 1000.
      b. A random real number between 0.3 and 0.4


   6. What does the following code print when
       a) m=7 n=7    b) m=3 n=5     c) m=0 n=2

     // read in integers m and n   
     int z = ((m > 0) && (m == n-2)) ? m+1 : n+1;
     switch (z) {
        case 0:
          System.out.println(z);
          break;
        case 1:
        case 2:
          System.out.println(z);
          System.out.println("could be either");
        case 3:
          System.out.println("Getting bigger");
          break;
        default:
          System.out.println("Nothing specific");
        }


   7. Write a segment of code that given an integer n (here 5), prints out
      1 1 1 1 1
      2 2 2 2
      3 3 3
      4 4
      5


   8. Suppose that the hypothetical froogle function, fr(x), is
      calculated as absol((x-1) * (x+1)) where absol(x) is the
      absolute value of x. 

      Write a program that reads in a double value for x from the
      user, calculates fr(x), and then prints it out.


   9. Write a segment of code that, given an integer array a which is
      filled with values, creates a new second array that is twice as
      long. In the first half of the array should be all of the same
      values as in the first, and in the second half of the array
      should be the values that are twice as large as the corresponding
      ones in the initial array.


   10. What's wrong with the following code segment?

      int i,j;
      String[] names;
      names[0] = new String("mary");
      names[1] = "john";
      i = names.length;
      j = names[0].length();
